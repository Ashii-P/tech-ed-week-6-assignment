<h1>Week 6 Assignment: Clicker Game on React</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an Octo-clicker game suitable for desktops, tablets and mobile. The game consists of an octopus that can be clicked to earn TentaCash which could be later used to buy power boosts, these points are displayed on the clicks per second counter. Both Tentacash and Clicks per Second are displayed. The game is equipped with sound effects and music that can be turned on/off through the menu button. You will also find a game reset button here. If unsure of how to play the game there is a how-to-play button, that will have further information.

<h2>How To Get The Game</h2>
You can download the game from the git repository attached to this. You can also play it by clicking on the deployment link.

<h2>Assignment Reflection</h2> 
I started this project with high aims, unfortunately due to internet problems I feel like I wasn't able to achieve them so although my game has the basic functions of a clicker game with adjustable settings, I do feel like I could have done more. In the future I am to be more precise with my CSS and start honing more of my css animation skills. I did want to practice more of my server side coding so I successfully attempted to make my own API. As a little bonus mention the cute little octopus in the game was illustrated by me. 
<h2>Acknowledment </h2>
I would not have been able to achieve any of the animation effects without the help of many other coders. The following links will direct you to coding tutorials I had taken inspiration from:
